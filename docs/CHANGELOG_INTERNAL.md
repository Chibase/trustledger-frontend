# Internal changelog

## 2026-07-23 — HS-1: start HubSpot cutover (Frappe CRM Lead SoT)

- ADR-034: Frappe CRM Lead is acquisition SoT; ADR-011 superseded for HubSpot-first magnet.
- Production: unset `LEAD_BACKEND` + Frappe keys ⇒ **frappe-only** (no HubSpot fallback). Explicit `auto` / `hubspot` remain for emergency.
- Ops readiness + `/api/health`: `leadBackend` / `leadBackendCutover` / `hubspotFallbackActive`.
- Runbook `docs/HS_CUTOVER.md`; CRM_HANDOFF / LEAD_FORMS / ACCESS_MODEL / FRAPPE_CLOUD_SETUP aligned.
- BUILD_PLAN packets HS-1 (active) → HS-4 (delete HubSpot client).

## 2026-07-23 — VIP complimentary access (Ops)

- `provisionOwnerCloud` / `POST /api/frappe/provision-owner`: `complimentaryVip` + `complimentaryUntil` → Customer `VIP Pilot — …`, plan default **institutional**, status **active**, Paystack billing cleared, Desk Comment stamped; no Frappe welcome email (operator shares temp password).
- Ops **Accounts**: **VIP complimentary access** panel (dry-run + create + temp password).
- Runbook: `docs/VIP_ACCESS.md`.
- Public `/trial` and `/pay` unchanged; VIP guests use `/login/live` only.

## 2026-07-23 — Platform Strategic Brief (living)

- Added `docs/PLATFORM_STRATEGIC_BRIEF.md`: achievements journey, front/back architecture, keep/improve/cut inventory, plan packaging matrix, public agent scripts, evaluation cadence, future upgrades
- Pointed `AGENTS.md` + `VERSIONING.md` + BUILD_PLAN + PUBLIC_LAUNCH at the brief

## 2026-07-23 — ADR-033: retire sample demo; Cloud SI north star

- Public `/demo` → `/product` (onboarding + feature purpose); no guest `tl-mode=demo` workspace
- Active packets: D1/D2 + SI-Cloud (TL Stakeholder / Engagement / Commitment)
- CTAs retarget `/product` or `/trial`; lingering demo sessions cleared from `/app`
- Ops: ensure DocTypes now includes SI; smoke Stakeholder→Engagement→Commitment
- Live BFF `GET/POST /api/frappe/si`; CRM create + services persist to Cloud when live

## 2026-07-23 — Access email verification (live OTP + trial gate)

- Live `/login/live`: password then 6-digit email OTP (Resend) before session cookies
- Trial `/pay/success`: no auto workspace — verify via emailed `/pay/activate` link
- `ACCESS_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` (auto-on in Production when Resend set); readiness + health gates

## 2026-07-23 — First-days hardening: reCAPTCHA + launch gates

- Production forms: tighter rate limit without captcha keys; verify whenever keys set
- `FORM_REQUIRE_RECAPTCHA=1` fail-closed when keys missing; Google attribution on forms
- Ops readiness + `/api/health` expose launch hardening (auto-provision, cron, Resend, reCAPTCHA)
- Docs: LEAD_FORMS / LAUNCH_WATCHLIST — turn on reCAPTCHA env steps

## 2026-07-23 — Launch hardening: no demo INC-* in customer desks

- Live incident/project lists: empty Cloud ≠ mock seed; customer/trial never fall back to demo data
- Invite accept uses `trial` mode (customer workspace) instead of `demo`
- Settings lockdown copy: TrustLedger ops (not Chibase product framing)
- `docs/LAUNCH_WATCHLIST.md` + refreshed `PUBLIC_LAUNCH.md` (GO LIVE posture)

## 2026-07-23 — GO LIVE Done (operator confirmed)

- Ops `/ops/readiness` green on Production; TrustLedger operational-grade for paying customers
- OPERATIONAL_DELIVERY / ROADMAP / PLATFORM_OPERATOR mark GO LIVE Done
- Next: Cloud V002 deepening (Engagement/Commitment DocTypes, Stats SA, live Grok)

## 2026-07-23 — GO LIVE ladder: Done when gates green

- GO LIVE lane → **done** when `goLiveReady` (env + `PLATFORM_OPERATOR_ONLY=0`)
- Lockdown-ON listed in `blockedReasons`; clearer Ops badge copy
- `deploySha` on readiness panel + `GET /api/health` for Production smoke
- Docs: do not re-set `PLATFORM_OPERATOR_ONLY=1` (re-blocks GO LIVE)

## 2026-07-23 — Step 5 Done → GO LIVE active on Ops ladder

- `step5Complete=true`; Ops `/ops/readiness` advances to GO LIVE
- GO LIVE desk checklist; `goLiveReady` when env gates + lockdown lifted
- OPERATIONAL_DELIVERY marks Steps 1–5 Done; GO LIVE Active

## 2026-07-23 — Packet 24g: Intelligence / ESG indicators (demo)

- `/app/intelligence` — place picker, indicator KPI cards, AI brief suggest→apply→save
- `mockIndicators` + geoService merge; local `tl-esg-briefs` store
- Mock `generateIndicatorBrief` only (no LLM keys / no Cloud brief call)
- Project/demo `esgIndicators` capability; V002 demo packets 24c–24g complete

## 2026-07-23 — Packet 24e: Grievance verify/close on case desk

- Process stages add **Verified** between Resolved and Closed
- Case desk: Advance stage + Verify & close; stamps + timeline events
- `incidentService.save` persists overlays (demo/org); list/get merge local
- Cloud TL Incident workflow stamps still follow-up

## 2026-07-23 — Packet 24d: Commitments status board (demo)

- Buyer `/login/live` smoke passed with `PLATFORM_OPERATOR_ONLY=0`
- Ops readiness ladder: Steps 1–4 Done; active Step 5 (V002 depth)
- Lockdown gate flipped to “lifted” (no longer blocks readiness after ADR-013 lift)

## 2026-07-23 — Sign-out: stop middleware dashboard bounce

- `/login?signedOut=1` and `?repaired=1` bypass the signed-in redirect and clear session cookies
- Sign-out / session repair use hard navigation (`location.assign`) to avoid soft-nav cookie races

## 2026-07-23 — Sign-out → account chooser

- Sign out / leave trial clears demo + live sessions and lands on `/login?signedOut=1` (no auto-demo)
- `/login` chooser: live again / different account, trial, demo; quick demo role collapsed
- Support session repair redirects to `/login?repaired=1`

## 2026-07-23 — OD-4: Day-14 charge cron + entitlement gate

- Customer billing fields: `custom_bill_at`, `custom_authorization_code`, `custom_plan_amount_cents`
- `GET|POST /api/cron/charge-due` (+ `vercel.json` daily cron); Ops Finance dry-run/charge panel
- Charge success → `active`; fail → `past_due`; live login blocks past_due/cancelled when not Ops
- Step 3 Done; Step 4 active — human lifts `PLATFORM_OPERATOR_ONLY=0` after smoke

## 2026-07-22 — OD-3: Paystack auto-provision + org migrate

- Shared `provisionOwnerOnCloud` (API-key, idempotent); Ops provision-owner uses it
- Paystack verify/webhook creates Customer+User when `FRAPPE_AUTO_PROVISION=1`
- `POST /api/frappe/migrate-org` + `/login/live` one-shot browser → Cloud DocTypes
- Step 2 Done; Step 3 active on Ops readiness; lockdown stays ON

## 2026-07-22 — OD-2: Product DocTypes + Cloud File BFF

- Step 1 marked Done; Step 2 active on Ops readiness

- `POST /api/frappe/product-smoke` + Ops smoke button (Project→Incident→Evidence)
- `POST /api/frappe/upload-file` — Frappe `upload_file` proxy
- `docs/PRODUCT_DOCTYPES.md`; OPERATIONAL_DELIVERY Step 2 checklist

## 2026-07-22 — Live password reset + Ops set temp password

- `/login/live` → Forgot password? → `POST /api/auth/live/forgot-password` (Frappe email reset)
- Ops Accounts → Set temp password → `POST /api/frappe/set-user-password` (operator + issuance; returns one-time temp password)
- Unblocks Step 1 Owner smoke when welcome/reset email is missing

## 2026-07-22 — OD-1b: Auto-ensure Desk custom fields

- `POST /api/frappe/ensure-custom-fields` (operator + issuance) creates Customer/User `custom_*` fields via API
- Live `provision-owner` auto-ensures fields before Customer/User create; User payload includes desk/owner/customer customs
- Ops Accounts: Check / Create Desk fields buttons

- ADR-032; do not lift ADR-013 until Step 4

## 2026-07-22 — Packets T4 + T5: media quotas + Frappe SoT prep

- T4: Org media library (`tl-org-media`) with plan storage quotas + Settings meter
- Case desk file upload for trial/org; over-quota blocks with upgrade CTA
- T5: `docs/FRAPPE_SOT.md` + `POST /api/frappe/provision-owner` (operator + FRAPPE_OWNER_ISSUANCE)
- Ops Accounts: dry-run / create Customer+Owner drafts; ADR-013 lockdown stays on
- ADR-030, ADR-031

## 2026-07-22 — Packet T3: Org data space (no demo contamination)

- Customer/trial workspaces never merge `mockIncidents` / `mockProjects`
- Org-scoped store `tl-org-data` + CSV import (projects & cases) for Plan Owner
- Settings → Org data space; Activity/Reports/Create report use workspace lists
- Intake saves to org data space; ADR-029

## 2026-07-22 — Packet 24f: Activity + Reports dual dashboards

- `/app/dashboard` → Activity dashboard (nav + project activity pulse)
- `/app/reports` → Reports hub: Monthly (text+graphs), Executive (strategic/high-risk graphs), Board pack (presentation)
- Plan seniority gates packs; Plan Owner grants desks in Settings → Report pack access
- ADR-028; nav label “Reports”; evidence AI writer still under each pack

## 2026-07-22 — Hard-block Cloud report AI + reject user’s Month/Year template

- `/api/frappe` returns 403 for `compose_activity_report` / `generate_report_brief`
- Template detector covers “comprehensive monthly report”, `[Month/Year]`, Topic 1 placeholders
- Create report clears stale editor body; refuses drafts without `INC-*` or `trustledger-evidence` model

## 2026-07-22 — Reports ignore Frappe seed; purge browser templates

- Create report grounds only on `mockIncidents` / local demo·trial stores — never live Frappe lists
- Auto-purge Month-End / `[Insert …]` drafts from `tl-authored-reports`; library “Clear browser library”
- Removed dead Cloud compose/brief method paths from `FRAPPE_METHODS`
- Docs: `docs/FRAPPE_SAMPLE_DATA.md` — deleting ERPNext sample DocTypes does not fix LLM templates

## 2026-07-22 — Report AI: never use Frappe/Grok templates

- `generateReportBrief` and `composeActivityReport` both use local evidence writer only
- Template detector expanded for Month-End / `[Insert …]` / sales-metric placeholders
- Create report always seeds `mockIncidents` even when live Frappe list is empty
- Briefs cite real INC-* titles from demo data

## 2026-07-22 — Soft public launch + live Paystack readiness

- ADR-027: public trial/pay with live Paystack; Frappe live login stays operator-gated
- Bugbot rules (`.cursor/BUGBOT.md`), PR template, `docs/CURSOR_AGENTS.md`, `docs/PUBLIC_LAUNCH.md`
- Invite accept re-checks plan desk cap; opt-out verifies Paystack reference+email (no client auth-code)
- Stable trial temp password per reference; production requires trial/Paystack secret
- Launch checklist updated for live key cutover

## 2026-07-22 — Desk ranks 1 (Client/Board) → 5 (CLO)

- Five desks ordered high→low: funder, executive (CEO/MD), delivery, supervisor, clo
- Plan Owner desk by plan (Practitioner supervisor, Project delivery, Institutional funder)
- Invites only ranks strictly below Owner; higher options greyed in picker + privilege matrix
- Legacy `site` / `oversight` ids normalize to supervisor / executive

## 2026-07-22 — Invite desk exposure gated by plan

- Desk exposure on invite lists all tiers; desks above the plan are greyed / disabled
- Project: CLO / site / supervisor; Institutional: full ladder; Practitioner: no invites
- Privilege matrix columns for above-plan desks greyed; createOrgInvite enforces the cap

## 2026-07-22 — Settings: plan on top; Owner invites & privileges only

- Read-only plan banner at top of Settings (no plan / desk self-toggle for clients)
- Removed demo role switcher from Settings
- Plan Owner section: Team invites + desk privileges matrix for lower ranks
- Juniors see assigned desk only; off-plan privilege rows stay greyed

## 2026-07-22 — Grey out off-plan Settings controls

- Visibility-by-desk-tier rows outside the current plan are greyed / disabled with upgrade hint
- Plan capabilities locked rows visually muted; matrix edit is Plan Owner only
- Practitioner trial: graphs, CRM, capture, supervisor, ESG stay visible but unusable

## 2026-07-22 — Plan capabilities: Owner-only, plan-gated toggles

- Settings → Plan capabilities visible only to Plan Owner (juniors never see it)
- Full catalogue always listed; modules outside the plan are locked with upgrade CTA
- Only Institutional may toggle every feature; lower plans toggle included modules only
- Above-plan force-on overrides ignored; ADR-024 amended

## 2026-07-22 — T1+T2: Plan Owner org + team invites (demo)

- Browser org tenancy: Plan Owner workspace on trial/subscribe; seat caps per ACCESS_MODEL
- Dashboard master strip; Settings → Team / Seats invites (role + desk exposure)
- `/invite/accept` joins as junior with locked desk tier; Practitioner = Owner-only
- Data space / media quotas / Frappe User SoT deferred (T3–T5); ADR-026

## 2026-07-22 — Report AI: hard-bind to demo cases (no LLM guides)

- Create report always seeds `mockIncidents` / `mockProjects` into evidence
- Activity-report compose never calls Cloud LLM (was returning `[Month/Year]` guides when `AI_MOCK=false`)
- UI shows case IDs in scope before write; template detector expanded

## 2026-07-22 — AI report writes finished prose (not a template guide)

- Activity report AI always uses evidence-based local writer from picked topics + demo/workspace cases
- Rejects fill-in-the-blank / “how to write a report” LLM guides
- Output includes real case findings, trust pulse, dates, and author — apply into editor on generate

## 2026-07-22 — AI report write from picked topics (demo data)

- Create report: pick topics → AI writes narrative sections from workspace/demo cases, trust pulse, and Capture evidence
- Suggest → apply → save; project scope filters facts; mock compose uses structured section writers
- Desk-gated topics stay greyed / non-selectable

## 2026-07-22 — Trial subscribe (card verify + deferred charge)

- `/pay` default = 14-day trial: Paystack card verification, authorization on file, bill at trial end
- Success: thank you + login/temp password (email via Resend when configured); no Contact us CTA
- Trial activates immediately; first-login password change prompt; `/login/trial` + `/pay/activate`
- Banner opt-out cancels scheduled charge (`Trial Opt-Out` + deactivate authorization)
- Ops `/api/paystack/charge-due` for day-14 collection; ADR-025
- CRM sources: `Trial Authorize`, `Trial Opt-Out`

## 2026-07-22 — Create report (evidence-based, seniority-gated)

- `/app/reports` → Create a report wizard: kinds (monthly, GRM, ESG, H&S, B-BBEE, CSI, MEL, board…)
- Sections selectable; options above desk grade greyed (visible, not selectable)
- AI compose from workspace incidents + Capture evidence; save for performance/dispute use
- Dashboard Report library views packs by desk level
- Nav label: Create report

- Capability catalogue + plan defaults + sellable add-ons (`entitlements` types/config/lib)
- `FeatureGate`, nav capability filters, Settings add-on/override preview (admin)
- Desk panels honour plan capabilities alongside desk-tier visibility
- Pricing/seats unchanged — packaging revisit later; switches are ready

- Professional desk tiers (CLO → supervisor → site → delivery → oversight → funder) with admin visibility matrix in Settings
- Capture hub: minutes / attendance / social intel / pasted report → AI stakeholder extract + brief (suggest → apply)
- Stakeholder CRM framed as demo placeholder; growth via capture
- Supervisor ranked queue of CLO/site filings; senior desks get charts (ops chart primitives)
- Issue intake requires project (select or create) — projects merge into dashboard/list

- Report flow: issue → reporter (or anonymous) → sequential dialogs for city, DM, TC, ward
- Geo pack powers `/api/geo` for the form only; place KPIs and Places browse removed from client dashboard/report
- Case still stores full geo path for tracking and categorisation

- Removed TEDS maturity panels from `/app/*` (ops-only: `/ops`, `/ops/executive`)
- Cascading geo picker (any-order province/DM/city/TC/ward) via `/api/geo`
- Intake: complaint natures, urgency, client junior/senior threshold, TAT stage targets
- AI triage suggests nature + staff routing (suggest → apply)
- Trust pulse (sentiment → trust index + TAT) on all role dashboards and client reports
- Case desk shows process stage timeline vs client targets

- `buildClientPortfolioBrief` aggregates projects, grievances, CRM, geo (same Frappe contract shapes)
- Client home → governance portfolio KPIs + CRM/geo panels
- `/app/reports` → printable portfolio trust brief for client/admin
- Geo + stakeholder services call live Frappe with seed fallback

- `src/lib/tedsMaturity.ts` + `docs/TEDS_MATURITY_REPORT.md` (~36% MVP progress)

## 2026-07-21 — Fix Vercel build (next/headers on client)

- Split server `readTrialSnapshot` into `trial.server.ts`
- Client `/trial` + incident service no longer import `next/headers` via `auth`/`trial`

## 2026-07-21 — WP plan links → Paystack + trial

- Home paste: plan cards → `/pay?plan=…` and `/trial?plan=…` (Institutional → contact)

- Subscribe form maze removed from trial funnel (ADR-022)

## 2026-07-20 — Pricing → Paystack plans

- Practitioner R5,399 / Project R14,999 defaults in `paystackPlans.ts`

- Plan catalogue `src/config/plans.ts` + `docs/LAUNCH_PLANS.md` / `docs/PAYSTACK_SETUP.md`

## 2026-07-16 — Quote + EFT soft-launch bridge (23i)

- `/quote` → CRM Lead `Quote Request` (+ optional `OPS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`)
- Ops → Finance → **Confirm EFT paid** → CRM Lead `EFT Payment` for Finance/Executive
- Trial / demo CTAs prefer quote over Paystack while KYC finalises

- Lead intake stores structured Sector / Demo role / UTM / Comment for cleaner future parsing

## 2026-07-15 — Executive Board brief (23e)

- ADR-016: `/ops/executive` is the C-suite board/investor surface; `/ops` stays junior day-to-day activity
- KPIs, weekly trend, activity mix, funnel, rating charts, talking points + print/copy
- Operator live login homes to `/ops/executive`

## 2026-07-15 — Ops = client activity (not product desk)

- Operator live login defaults to `/ops` (not `/app/dashboard`)
- Login API returns `home: /ops`; middleware bounces operators off `/app/dashboard` → `/ops`
- `/ops` + `/ops/activity` show demos / assessments / feedback / contact / support — not projects or issues
- Nav no longer treats the customer product desk as the operator home; Cloud CRM remains for record detail

## 2026-07-15 — Platform Ops command centre (23a)

- ADR-015 + `docs/PLATFORM_OPS.md`: `/ops` allowlist-only overview (not a CRM)
- Health + CRM Lead intake intel; Reports/Accounts stubs for later packets

- Unauthenticated `/app` in live data mode goes to `/login/live` (not demo)

## 2026-07-14 — UI branding sweep

- Removed user-facing “Frappe” / vendor doc paths; Settings, login, status, support, AI copy use TrustLedger (Cloud) / Chibase Consulting

## 2026-07-14 — CRM Desk bootstrap

- `/api/frappe/crm-setup` (token-gated) creates Lead Sources, default Job Title/Source columns, pinned views

## 2026-07-14 — Contact + launch feedback

- `/contact` form replaces mailto bounce; posts to CRM Lead
- Post-assessment feedback form + demo shell **Feedback** drawer (rating + note → CRM)
- CRM Lead **Job Title** + **Source** + structured Comment for relevance triage (`docs/CRM_VIEWS.md`)

## 2026-07-13 — Honeypot autofill fix

- Renamed lead honeypot from `company_url` → `tl_hp` (password managers were autofilling website fields and silently dropping real leads)
- Server still accepts legacy `company_url`; logs when honeypot trips

## 2026-07-13 — Frappe Cloud cutover wiring

- Lead APIs prefer Frappe CRM Lead (`FRAPPE_API_KEY`/`SECRET`) with HubSpot fallback
- Docs: `docs/FRAPPE_CLOUD_SETUP.md` (Vercel env, CORS, smoke)

- Demo remains public unless `PLATFORM_OPERATOR_LOCK_PUBLIC=1`

## 2026-07-12 — Post-payment access model

- ADR-012 + `docs/ACCESS_MODEL.md`: Plan Owner = org admin; Owner confirms lower-role invites by plan seats

## 2026-07-12 — CRM handoff model

- ADR-011 + `docs/CRM_HANDOFF.md`: HubSpot Free = lead magnet; Frappe owns relationships after commitment

## 2026-07-12 — Support Phase A

- In-app Support drawer (self-serve + HubSpot tickets)
- `/status` + `/api/health` (Vercel + Frappe Cloud probes)
- Issue catalog + allowlist in `docs/SUPPORT_OPS.md`
- Repair session + live sign-in shortcuts

## 2026-07-11 — Demo entry lead capture

- `/demo` requires name + work email before start (same bar as assessment)
- Posts to HubSpot with `[Source: demo_entry]` for marketing segmentation
- Soft gate remains as backup (`demo_soft_gate`) if entry was skipped

## 2026-07-11 — Launch hardening

- Shared `PageHeader`, `KpiCard`, `StatusChip`, `IncidentTable`
- Role dashboards: KPI strips, status chips, concern tables (Field ledger tokens)

## 2026-07-11 — Assessment → HubSpot

- `/api/assessment/lead` submits to HubSpot Forms API (EU) when `HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` + `HUBSPOT_FORM_ID` are set
- Maps name/email/company + assessment summary into the form `message` field
